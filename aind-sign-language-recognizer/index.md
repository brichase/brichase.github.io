## Sign Language Recognizer using Hidden Markov Models (May 2017)
* Compared   3   model   selection   criterions   for   Hidden   Markov   Model   for   recognizing   sign   language  
* Best   model   achieved   a   0.528   word   error   rate   (84   out   of   178   correct)   using   Discriminative   Information
Criterion   with   polar   coordinate   features
