## End-to-End Facial Keypoint Recognition System (October 2017)  
* Combined OpenCV face detection and Keras 6-layer Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) model to predict facial keypoints
* Achieved validation loss of 0.0012 in 300 epochs by looping through different optimizers

Here is the iPython notebook with the code:
