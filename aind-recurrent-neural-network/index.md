## Recurrent Neural Networks to predict stock prices and generate words from Novel (September 2017)
* Finished   functions   to   model   RNNs   to   predict   apple   stock   market   prices   and   generate   sentences   from   the novel   Sherlock   Holmes
* Utilized   simple   RNN   model   using   LSTM   modules   that   achieved   a   testing   error   of   0.014   in   stock   prediction and   generated   english   words   from   novel   text
